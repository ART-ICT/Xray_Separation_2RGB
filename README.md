# Xray_Separation_2RGB_log-model
<i> Software for mixed X-ray image separaration when 2 visible images are available (e.g. double-sided paintings)</i>

The software available here is designed to separate the mixed X-radiographs from double-sided paintings into two hypothetical X-ray images corresponding to each side of the painting, when visible images of the two sides of the painting are available. The software is described in the following publication:

<b>The datasets used in the paper:</b>
The visible images and X-radiographs from the Ghent altarpiece that are described in the paper are available via http://closertovaneyck.kikirpa.be/ghentaltarpiece/#home (and were registered by the authors prior to use). 

The images sets from taken from a painting that is only painted on one side that were used to assess the regularization parameters associated with the separation approach are available at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7886671
